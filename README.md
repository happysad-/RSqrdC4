# RSqrdC4

## What is it?

RSquaredC4 is a stream cipher which is built upon the RC4 (**[Rivest Cipher 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4)**).

## Why?

I am interested in understanding how encryption, decryption and ciphers work. Considering that RC4 is a relatively simple
design, I have chosen it as a base upon which features are going to be built.

## Features

- [x] Base of RC4 encryption and decryption
- [ ] Make the key paddable and have no limited constrictions to size of the key (as long as it is > 1)
- [ ] Multiple rounds which would affect the stream itself
- [ ] \(Optional) Fixed stream size which does not vary upon data input size

## Notice
I am not responsible for any use of the code provided in this project which may be vulnerable and exploitable.
This project is the basis of learning how encryption works and not a full blown solution to encryption / decryption and
protecting sensitive data.
I am a novice at cryptography and therefore I understand that the code will not be to industry standard.
